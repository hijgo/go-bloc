This package implements a adaption of the BloC-Design-Pattern for go.

## What is the BloC-Design-Pattern? ðŸ˜…
Generally speaking, BLoC (Business Logic Component) is a design pattern enabling developers to efficiently and conveniently manage state across their apps without a tight coupling between the presentation (view) and the logic. It also aims for reusability of the same logic across multiple widgets. It was first mentioned by Google at the Google I/O in 2018.
